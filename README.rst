weaksig-plot
============

WSPR, JT65, JT9 and other weak signal modes: read, analyze, plot data. Minimalistic.
Right now, the emphasis is on expressing expected ranges of SNR/Hz/Watt, binned by range (groundwave, NVIS, DX) and local time for each frequency band (3 MHz, 5 MHz, etc.).
This helps understand what is feasible for general NVIS communications systems referenced to narrowband weak signal modes such as WSPR.

The swarm plot gives a sense of how many samples are at a given configuration--if the maximum width is reached, then you know there are at least N measurements for that result.

The box plot give the traditional sense of distribution of variables--here also versus dawn/morning/afternoon/dusk and distance bins.
